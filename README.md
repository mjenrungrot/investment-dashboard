# investment-dashboard
`investment-dashboard` is a simple dashboard for managing your own investment. Using PostgreSQL, the dashboard is able to store your investment portfolio, especially the allocation in each of your investment like stock equity, cryptocurrency. In the future, this dashboard will be incorporated with an algorithmic trading tool where users can do the backtest system. The dashboard will also include the notification system for following any stock price in the stock market.

The development of this project will be based mainly on Django + Python 3.6, and the progress of `investment-dashboard` is separated roughly into 4 phases:
- [ ] Initial Baseline Setup (https://github.com/mjenrungrot/investment-dashboard/projects/1)
- [ ] Equity Price Tracking System
- [ ] News Fetching System
- [ ] Backtesting
